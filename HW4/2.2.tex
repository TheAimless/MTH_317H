\begin{question}
	\normalfont
	
	Define the list, $\ell=x_1,x_2,x_3$ \hspace{.1cm} of vectors in $\real^3$, where 
	\begin{align*}
		x_1 = \ColVecThree{1}{2}{3}\ \ 
		x_2 = \ColVecThree{1}{2}{1}\ \
		x_3 = \ColVecThree{1}{0}{1}.
	\end{align*}
	You will prove that $\ell$ is a basis for $\real^3$ via two different methods.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Prove, from the definitions of linear independence and span that $\ell$ is linearly independent and $\SpanLA(\ell)=\real^3$, hence that $\ell$ is a basis of $\real^3$.  For the proof of the span, you must use the typical set equality proof, in which you will establish that $\SpanLA(\ell)\subseteq \real^3$ and $\real^3\subseteq \SpanLA(\ell)$.  Note, for your span proof, it may be easiest to first show that the canonical basis vectors satisfy $e_1,e_2,e_3\in \SpanLA(\ell)$.
		
		\item Use some combination of the results in LADR 2.C to prove that $\ell$ is a basis for $\real^3$.
		
		\item Do you have a preference for either method?
		
	\end{enumerate}
