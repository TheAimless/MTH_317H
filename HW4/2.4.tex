\begin{question}
	\normalfont
	Assume that the list $B= q_1, \dots, q_m $ \hspace{.1cm} is a basis for $\P_4$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Is it possible that no polynomial in $B$ has degree 4? Prove your answer.
		\item Is it possible that no polynomial in $B$ has degree 2? Prove your answer.
		\item What must be the value of $m$ (the length of the list, $B$)?  Prove your answer. \\
	\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item No. Assume the contrary. Then, there exists a solution to the equation $x^4=a_1q_1(x)+a_2q_2(x)+...+a_mq_m(x)$ for some $a_1,a_2,...,a_m\in\R$ and the coefficient for $x^4$ of $q_1,...,q_m$ is $0$.
        However, that means the coefficients of $x^4$ for $a_1q_1(x),a_2q_2(x),...,a_mq_m(x)$ 
    \end{enumerate}
