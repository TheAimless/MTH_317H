	Assume that the list $B= q_1, \dots, q_m $ \hspace{.1cm} is a basis for $\P_4$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Is it possible that no polynomial in $B$ has degree 4? Prove your answer.
		\item Is it possible that no polynomial in $B$ has degree 2? Prove your answer.
		\item What must be the value of $m$ (the length of the list, $B$)?  Prove your answer. \\
