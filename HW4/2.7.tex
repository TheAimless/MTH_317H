	Prove that in any vector space, $V$, if the ordered list, $B=v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ \hspace{.1cm} is a basis for $V$, then for 
	\begin{align*}
		C= w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 ,
	\end{align*}
	where
	\begin{align*}
		w_1=v_1+v_2,\ \  w_2=v_2+v_3,\ \  w_3=v_2,\ \  w_4=v_2 + v_4,
	\end{align*}
	$C$ is also a basis for $V$.  \\
	
	\noindent Prove this by two different methods, as follows:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Use the definitions of linear independence and span to show that $C$ is a basis. (Hint: for span, try to show that $v_i\in\SpanLA(C)$.)
		
		\item Use the results of LADR 2.C to show that $C$ is a basis of $V$.
	\end{enumerate}
