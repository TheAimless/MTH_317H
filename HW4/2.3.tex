	Define a list $\ell = p_1, p_2$ \hspace{.1cm}of vectors in $\P_3$, where
	\begin{align*}
		p_1(x) = 1+x^2,\ \ \ 
		p_2(x) = 1-x^2.
	\end{align*}
	Add vectors to the list, $\ell$, so that it becomes a basis for $\P_3$.  Prove that your new list is both linearly independent and that it spans $\P_3$.
