	Define a list $\ell = p_1, p_2$ \hspace{.1cm}of vectors in $\P_3$, where
	\begin{align*}
		p_1(x) = 1+x^2,\ \ \ 
		p_2(x) = 1-x^2.
	\end{align*}
	Add vectors to the list, $\ell$, so that it becomes a basis for $\P_3$.  Prove that your new list is both linearly independent and that it spans $\P_3$.
\end{question}

\begin{proof}
    \renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{$\blacksquare$}
    Let $p_3,p_4\in\P_3$ such that 
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            p_3(x)=x,\ \ \
            p_4(x)=x^3
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    To prove that the new list $\ell'=p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ is both linearly independent and spans $\P_3$, let $a,b,c,d\in\R$ be solution to $ap_1+bp_2+cp_3+dp_4=\vec{0}$. We have 
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            0 &= ap_1(x)+bp_2(x)+cp_3(x)+dp_4(x)\\
              &= a(1+x^2)+b(1-x^2)+cx+dx^3\\
              &= (a+b)+cx+(a-b)x^2+dx^3   
        \end{aligned}
    \]
    Then, for $(a+b)+cx+(a-b)x^2+dx^3=0$ for any $x\in\R$, $a+b=c=a-b=d=0$, or $a=b=c=d=0$. Hence, the only solution to $ap_1+bp_2+cp_3+dp_4=\vec{0}$ is the trivial solution, or $\ell'$ is linearly independent.

    Since $\ell'$ has four vectors and all four vectors in $\P_3$ are linearly independent, from Theorem 2.39 Section 2.C LADR it follows that $\ell'$ forms a basis for $\P_3$. It follows that $\ell'$ spans $\P_3$.
    Therefore, $\ell'$ is both linearly independent and spans $\P_3$
\end{proof}
