	Let $\ell=v_1,\dots, v_6$ and $s=w_1\dots,w_6$ be ordered lists of vectors in $\real^3$, where:
	\begin{align*}
		v_1 = \ColVecThree{1}{2}{3}\ \ 
		v_2 = \ColVecThree{1}{1}{1}\ \
		v_3 = \ColVecThree{3}{4}{5}\ \ 
		v_4 = \ColVecThree{2}{1}{2}\ \ 
		v_5 = \ColVecThree{0}{0}{1}\ \ 
		v_6 = \ColVecThree{1}{0}{3}
	\end{align*}
	and
	\begin{align*}
		w_1 = \ColVecThree{1}{0}{3}\ \ 
		w_2 = \ColVecThree{0}{0}{1}\ \
		w_3 = \ColVecThree{1}{2}{3}\ \ 
		w_4 = \ColVecThree{1}{1}{1}\ \ 
		w_5 = \ColVecThree{3}{4}{5}\ \ 
		w_6 = \ColVecThree{2}{1}{2}.
	\end{align*}

	Recall that the vectors in the canonical basis for $\real^3$ are
	
	\begin{align*}
		e_1 = \ColVecThree{1}{0}{0}\ \
		e_2 = \ColVecThree{0}{1}{0}\ \
		e_3 = \ColVecThree{0}{0}{1}. 
	\end{align*}

	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Prove that $e_1,e_2,e_3\in\SpanLA(\ell)$.
		\item Prove that $\SpanLA(\ell)=\real^3$.
		\item Use the reduction algorithm in LADR Result 2.31 to reduce the list $\ell$ to a basis.  What is the resulting list?    For this you must show each step of the algorithm, including the calculation of whether or not a vector is in the span of the previous vectors.  Then just state the resulting list.  Give a one sentence explanation for why your answer for the span of the resulting list is what it is.
		\item Use the reduction algorithm in LADR Result 2.31 to reduce the list $s$ to a basis.  What is the resulting list?  Is it the same list as the algorithm applied to $\ell$?  Does order matter in this algorithm?  Does the ordering of the original vectors affect the span of the reduced list?
