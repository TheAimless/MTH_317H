(a) Consider the linear map $D: \P_3 \to \P_2$ given by differentiation. In other words $(Dp)(x) = p'(x)$. Find a basis of $\P_3$ and a basis of $\P_2$ such that the matrix of $D$ with respect to these bases is 
\[
\left( \begin{array}{rrrr}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right)
\]

\noindent (b) Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces, and $T$ is a linear map $T: V \to W$. Prove that there exists a basis of $V$ and a basis of $W$ such that all entries of the matrix of $T$ with respect to these bases are 0 except that the entry in row $j$, column $j$ is 1 for all $1\leq j \leq \dim (\textup{range} T$).
