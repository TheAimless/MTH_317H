\begin{question}

	Use mathematical induction to prove the following statement:
	\begin{align*}
		\textnormal{for all}\ n\in\Natural,\ \ 
		\MatTwoTwo{2}{0}{-1}{1}^n
		= \MatTwoTwo{2^n}{0}{1-2^n}{1}.
	\end{align*}
	Note, in this class we are using the convention that $\Natural = \{1,2,3,\dots\}$, i.e. $0\not\in\Natural$.
	Also, we are using the notation for the power of a matrix that if $A$ is a square matrix, then by $A^n$, we mean $A$ multiplied by itself $n$ times; i.e.
	\begin{align*}
		A^2 = AA,\ \ A^3 = AAA,\ \ A^n = A\cdots A\ \ \textnormal{with $n$ terms in the product}.
	\end{align*}
	
	Your inductive proof must include the following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item identify and state what is the conditional statement, $P(n)$, for $n\in \Natural$.
		\item state which natural number you will use as the base case, and prove that the conditional statement is true for the base case.
		\item for a fixed $k\in\Natural$, state the inductive assumption.
		\item prove the inductive step.  That is to say, prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true.
		\item conclude.
	\end{enumerate}
