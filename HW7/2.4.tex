\begin{question}
\normalfont
\noindent Without citing LADR result 3.59, show explicitly that  $\P_3$ is isomorphic to the vector space of $2\times2$ matrices with entries in the real numbers, $M_{2\times 2}(\real)$. In other words, define linear maps (and prove that they are linear)
\[
T: \P_3 \to M_{2\times2}(\real)
\]
and 
\[
S: M_{2\times2}(\real) \to \P_3
\]
such that $ST$ is the identity map on $\P_3$ and $TS$ is the identity map on $M_{2\times2}(\real)$.  \\
