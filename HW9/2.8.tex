\begin{question}
\normalfont
Let $S$ be an invertible $l \times l$ matrix and $D$ be an $l \times l$ matrix. Use mathematical induction to prove 
$$
\left(S D S^{-1} \right)^n = S D^n S^{-1}, \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N}.
$$ 
Your inductive proof must include the following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item identify and state what is the conditional statement, $P(n)$, for $n\in \Natural$.
		\item state which natural number you will use as the base case, and prove that the conditional statement is true for the base case.
		\item for a fixed $k\in\Natural$, state the inductive assumption.
		\item prove the inductive step.  That is to say, prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true.
		\item conclude.
	\end{enumerate}
