\begin{question}
\normalfont
Let $T:\real^3\to\real^3$ be the linear function defined as
		\begin{align*}
			T(\ColVecThree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}) = \ColVecThree{x_1-x_2}{-x_1+2x_2-2x_3}{2x_2 + x_3}.
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item Let $A$ denote the matrix of the linear transformation $T$ with respect to the standard basis of $\real^3$. Find the matrix $A$, and find det($A$). \\

\item Consider the basis 
\[
\ColVecThree{1}{1}{1}, \ColVecThree{0}{1}{1},
 \ColVecThree{1}{0}{1}
\]
of $\real^3$.  Let $B$ denote the matrix of the transformation $T$ with respect to this basis for both the domain and the target. Find the matrix $B$, and find det($B$). \\


\item Considering your answers to parts (i) and (ii) above, make a conjecture about how the determinant of matrix representing a linear transformation depends on the bases of the domain and target. You do not need to prove your conjecture. 
\end{enumerate}
