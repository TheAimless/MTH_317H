	Let $L:\P_5\to P_4$ be the linear function given by 
	\begin{align*}
		L(p) = 7p'' + 3p'.
	\end{align*}
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Give a list of polynomials, $\ell = \{n_1,\dots, n_m\}$ so that $\ell$ is a basis for $\NullLA(L)$.  Prove that your choice is correct.
		
		
		\item Prove that given any polynomial, $q\in \P_4$, there exists $p\in\P_5$ so that $L(p)=q$.  (Hint, think about surjectivity. You should be able to do dimension counting and use LADR result 3.22.  I would suggest \emph{not} to prove the existence of $q$ from scratch.)
		
		\item For a given $q$ as in the previous step, is the choice of $p$ unique?  Explain your answer.
		
	\end{enumerate}
