    Determine if each of the following sets is a subspace.  You can use the conditions in LADR result 1.34 to confirm whether it is or is not a subspace.  If you are confirming ``yes'', then you must verify the requirements in result 1.34 for generic vectors and scalars (following the instructions above).  If you are justifying ``no'', then you must choose a property from result 1.34 that fails, and also you must give concrete choices of vectors and/or scalars that demonstrate the failure.

\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item To show that $W_1$ is a subspace of $\P_4$, the three following properties must hold true:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item The zero vector of $\P_4$ belongs to $W_1$: Let $f=0\in\P_4$. Then, $f''=f=0$, or $f''+f=0$. Therefore, the zero vector of $\P_4$ belongs to $W_1$.
        \item Vector addition is closed under $W_1$: Let $u,v\in W_1$. Then, $u''+u=v''+v=0$. We have:
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                0 &= (u''+u)+(v''+v)\\
                  &= (u''+v'')+(u+v)
                  &= (u'+v')'+(u+v)\\
                  &= (u+v)''+(u+v)
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        It follows that $u+v\in W_1$, or vector addition is closed under $W_1$.
        \item Scalar multiplication is closed under $W_1$: Let $\lam\in\R$ and $u\in W_1$. Then, $u''+u=0$ and
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \lam(u''+u) &= \lam u''+\lam u\\
                            &= (\lam u')'+\lam u\\
                            &= (\lam u)''+\lam u
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        It follows that $\lam u\in W_1$, or scalar multiplication is closed under $W_1$.

    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, $W_1$ is a subspace of $\P_4$.
    \item Let $z=\Vec{0}\in\P_4$. Then, $z''=z'=0$, or
    \[
        z''+z=0\not=1
    \]
    Therefore, $z\not\in W_2$, or the zero vector of $\P_4$ does not belong to $W_2$. It follows that $W_2$ is not a subspace of $\P_4$.
    \item For $W_3$ to be a subset of $\R^{3}$, it has to satisfy the three following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item The zero vector of $\R^{3}$ belongs to $W_3$: Let $x_1,x_2,x_3\in\R$ such that $x_1=x_2=x_3=0$. Let $u=\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\in\R^{3}$. Then, $u$ is the zero vector of $\R^{3}$ and $x_2=3x_1-6x_3$. Therefore, $u\in W_3$, or the zero vector of $\R^{3}$ belongs to $W_3$.
        \item Let $u=\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}$ and $v=\colvecthree{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}$, where $x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,y_3\in\R$, $x_2=3x_1-6x_3$ and $y_2=3y_1-6y_3$. Then, $u,v\in\R^{3}$, and
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                u+v &= \colvecthree{x_1+y_1}{x_2+y_2}{x_3+y_3}\\
                    &= \colvecthree{x_1+y_1}{(3x_1-6x_3)+(3y_1-6y_2}{x_3+y_3}\\
                    &= \colvecthree{x_1+y_1}{3(x_1+y_1)-6(x_3+y_3)}{x_3+y_3}\in W_3
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Therefore, vector addition is closed under $W_3$.
        \item Scalar multiplication is closed under $W_3$: Let $\lam\in\R$ and $u=\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\in W_3$. Then, $x_2=3x_1-6x_3$, and
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \lam u &= \lam\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\\
                       &= \colvecthree{\lam x_1}{\lam (3x_1-6x_3)}{\lam x_3}\\
                       &= \colvecthree{\lam x_1}{3(\lam x_1)-6(\lam x_3)}{\lam x_3}\in W_3
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Therefore, scalar multiplication is closed under $W_3$.
    \end{enumerate}
    From the three properties above, it follows that $W_3$ is a subspace of $\R^{3}$.
    \item For $W_4$ to be a subspace of $\P_3$, we need to prove the three following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
        \item The zero vector of $\P_3$ belongs to $W_4$: Let $z=0\in\P_3$ be the zero vector of $\P_3$. Then, $z=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^{2}+a_3x^{3}$, where $a_0=a_1=a_2=a_3=0$. It follows that $z\in W_4$, or the zero vector of $\P_3$ belongs to $W_4$.
        \item Vector addition is closed under $W_4$: Let $u,v\in W_4$. Then, $u, v$ can be written as
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                u &= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^{2}+a_3x^{3}\\
                v &= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^{2}+b_3x^{3}
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        , where $a_2=b_2=0$. We have:
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                u+v &= (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^{2}+a_3x^{3})+(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^{2}+b_3x^{3})\\
                    &= (a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^{2}+(a_3+b_3)x^{3}
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Since $a_2=b_2=a_2+b_2=0$, it follows that $u+v\in W_4$. Therefore, vector addition is closed under $W_4$.
        \item Scalar multiplication is closed under $W_4$: Let $\lam\in\R$
    \end{enumerate}
