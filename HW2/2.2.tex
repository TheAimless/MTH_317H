	Here we will work in the vector space, $\real^3$, with the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication.  Define the following two sets:
	
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            &W_1 = \left\{ \colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\in \real^3\ :\ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0 \right\}\\
            &\text{and}\ \ \ 
            W_2 = \left\{ \colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\in \real^3\ :\ x_1 + 2x_2 - x_3 = 0 \right\}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Use LADR result 1.34 to prove that $W_1$ and $W_2$ are both subspaces of $\real^3$.  Note, your proofs should look very similar for each of $W_1$ and $W_2$.
		
		\item Consider the set $V=W_1\intersect W_2$.  List 3 distinct elements of $V$.
		
		\item Give a description of the set, 
		\begin{equation}
			V= W_1 \intersect W_2.
		\end{equation}
		That is to say, write $V$ in the form,
		\begin{equation}
			V = \left\{ \colvecthree{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}\in\real^3\ :\ v_1, v_2, v_3\ \text{satisfy some relationship} \right\}.
		\end{equation}
		There is no proof required here and your answer should just be a set, as suggested.

        \renewcommand\qedsymbol{$\blacksquare$}
        \begin{proof}
            To show that $W_1$ and $W_2$ are both subspaces of $\R^{3}$, we need to show that the three following properties hold true for both sets:
            \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
                \item The zero vector of $\R^{3}$ belongs to both $W_1$ and $W_2$: Let $x_1,x_2,x_3\in\R$ such that $x_1=x_2=x_3=0$. Let $u=\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}\in\R^{3}$. Then,
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        x_1+x_2+x_3=x_1+2x_2-x_3=0
                    \end{aligned}
                \]
                It follows that $u\in W_1$ and $u\in W_2$, or the zero vector of $\R^{3}$ belongs to both $W_1$ and $W_2$.
                \item Vector addition is closed under $W_1$ and $W_2$: Let $u,v\in W_1$ and $a,b\in W_2$. Then, we can write $u,v,a,b$ as
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        u = \colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3},
                        v = \colvecthree{y_1}{y_2}{y_3},
                        a = \colvecthree{p_1}{p_2}{p_3},
                        b = \colvecthree{q_1}{q_2}{q_3}
                    \end{aligned}  
                \]
                such that the components of the vectors are elements of $\R$. We have:
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        u+v = \colvecthree{x_1+y_1}{x_2+y_2}{x_3+y_3}
                    \end{aligned}    
                \]
                Since $x_1+x_2+x_3=y_1+y_2+y_3=0$,
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        (x_1+y_1)+(x_2+y_2)+(x_3+y_3)=0
                    \end{aligned}  
                \]
                Therefore, $u+v\in W_1$, or vector addition is closed under $W_1$.\\
                Similarly,
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        a+b = \colvecthree{p_1+q_1}{p_2+q_2}{p_3+q_3}
                    \end{aligned}  
                \]
                Since $p_1+2p_2-p_3=q_1+2q_2-q_3=0$, $(p_1+q_1)+2(p_2+q_2)-(p_3+q_3)=0$, it follows that $ a+b\in\ W_2 $. Therefore, vector addition is closed under $ W_2 $.
                \item Scalar multiplication is closed under $W_1$ and $W_2$: Let $u\in W_1, v\in W_2, \lam\in\R$. Then, $u,v$ can be written as $u=\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} $, $v=\colvecthree{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}$ such that $x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,y_3\in\R$ and $x_1+x_2+x_3=y_1+2y_2-y_3=0$. We have:
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        \lam u = \colvecthree{\lam x_1}{\lam x_2}{\lam x_3},
                        \lam v = \colvecthree{\lam y_1}{\lam y_2}{\lam y_3}
                    \end{aligned}
                \]
                Since $x_1+x_2+x_3=y_1+2y_2-y_3=0$, $\lam x_1+\lam x_2+\lam x_3=\lam y_1+2\lam y_2-\lam y_3=0$. Thus, $\lam u\in W_1$ and $\lam v\in W_2$, or scalar multiplication is closed under both $W_1$ and $W_2$.
            \end{enumerate}
            Therefore, $W_1$ and $W_2$ are both subspaces of $\R^{3}.$
        \end{proof}
        \item Let $u=\colvecthree{0}{0}{0}, v=\colvecthree{3}{-2}{-1}, w=\colvecthree{6}{-4}{-2}$. Then, $u,v,w$ can be written as $\colvecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3}$ satisfying 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                x_1+x_2+x_3 &= 0\\
                x_1+2x_2-x_3&= 0
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Therefore, $u,v,w$ are pairwise distinct elements of both $W_1$ and $W_2$, or $u,v,w\in V$.
        \item $V$ can be written as:
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                V=\left\{ \colvecthree{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}\ \in\R^{3} : -2v_1=3v_2=6v_3 \right\}
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        
    \end{enumerate}
