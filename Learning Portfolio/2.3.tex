    Let $L:\P_4\rightarrow\P_4$ be a linear function that has the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item For $p_0,p_1,p_2\in\P_4$ given by 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                p_0(x)=1,\ p_1(x)=x,\ p_2(x)=x^2,
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        $L$ has the values: 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                [L(p_0)](x)=x^4,\ [L(p_1)](x)=3,\ [L(p_2)](x)=x.
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        \item For $p_3(x)=x^3$ and $p_4(x)=x^4,L(p_3+p_4)=$ zero polynomial.
        \item $\dim(\nullla(L))=1$
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Characterize all possible linear functions, $L:\P_4\rightarrow\P_4$, that satisfy the above properties. That is to say, since ${p_0,...,p_4}$ is a basis for $\P_4$, explain all possible values of 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                L(p_3)\text{  and  }L(p_4)
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        \item Prove that your characterization is correct. That is to say, take a generic choice of one of the functions you gave in part (i) and prove that it does indeed satisfy conditions (a), (b), (c). Furthermore, take a generic choice of $L$ that satisfies (a), (b), (c) and show that it must also satisfy the conditions you have given in part (i).
        \item Give a basis for $\nullla(L)$ and a basis for $\range(L)$.
    \end{enumerate}
