\begin{question}
\normalfont In this problem you will prove that the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is the product of its eigenvalues (repeated with multiplicity), i.e. det$(A) =\lambda_1\lambda_2...\lambda_n$. You will do this in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item First, show that 
\[
\textup{det}(A-\lambda I) = (\lambda_1 - \lambda)(\lambda_2 - \lambda) \ldots (\lambda_n-\lambda),
\]
where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2,...\lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ (repeated with multiplicity). \\ \\
\emph{Hint: Use the fact that the eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, plus your result from Question \ref{degree} about the coefficient of $\lambda^n$ in the characteristic polynomial.}

\item Then, plug $\lambda=0$ into your formula from part (i) to conclude that the determinant of $A$ is the product of the eigenvalues. 
\end{enumerate}
