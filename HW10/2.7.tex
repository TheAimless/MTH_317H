\begin{question}	
	\normalfont
Let $R$ be any polygon in the plane. Prove that it is possible to divide $R$ into triangles, all of whose vertices are vertices of $R$.
Your inductive proof must include the following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item identify and state what is the conditional statement, $P(n)$, for $n\in \Natural, n \geq 3$.
		\item state which natural number you will use as the base case, and prove that the conditional statement is true for the base case.
		\item for a fixed $k\in\Natural$, state the inductive assumption.
		\item prove the inductive step.  That is to say, prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true.
		\item conclude.
	\end{enumerate}
