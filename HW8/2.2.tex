    Let $A$ be the matrix,
    \begin{align*}
        A =
        \MatrixThreeThree{1}{0}{1}{1}{3}{0}{3}{3}{2}
    \end{align*}

    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Compute the determinant of the matrix, $A$. Show your work.

        \item Is it possible to solve, for all $b\in\real^3$, the equation
              \begin{align*}
                  Ax=b?
              \end{align*}
              If you answer is ``yes'', then prove that there is a solution for each $b$, and if your answer is ``no'', then you must give an example of a particular $b$ so that there is no vector $x$ that solves the equation, and prove that there is no solution.
    \end{enumerate}
