    Let the matrices $A$ and $B$ be given as
    \begin{align*}
        A=
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\
            1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
            1 & 1 & 5 & 0
        \end{pmatrix}
        \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \
        B=
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 5  & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 5  & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & -5 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}


    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Show that the matrix $A$ can be row-reduced to the matrix $B$, using row operations.  Show your steps.

        \item Write down an invertible matrix, $T$, so that $TA=B$.  Do not supply a proof, just write down a matrix.  (Hint, keep track of the elementary matrices-- LADW p. 41, 42-- that correspond to your steps in part (i))

        \item Prove that $T$ is invertible.  (There are actually many ways one could argue this.)
    \end{enumerate}
