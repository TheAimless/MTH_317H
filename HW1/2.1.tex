\subsection*{Problem 2.1}
Let $\mathcal{P}_3$ denote the set of polynomials of degree less than or equal to 3, with real coefficients. For the following two sets, $A$ and $B$, prove that $A=B$.
	\begin{align*}
		&A = \{ p\in\mathcal{P}_3\ :\ p''=0    \}\\
		&B = \{ f(x)=a_0 + a_1 x\ :\ a_0,a_1\in\mathbb{R}    \}.
	\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
We will show that $A=B$ by proving that $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$.\\
To show that $A\subseteq B$, let $p\in A$ be arbitrary. Since $p\in A\subseteq\mathcal{P}_3$, $p$ is a function of $x$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2,
\end{equation*}
in which $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$. Then,
\begin{equation*}
    p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    p''(x) = 2a_2
\end{equation*}
Solving for $p''(x) = 0$, it follows that $a_2 = 0$. Thus,
\begin{equation*}
    p(x) = a_0 + a_1x,
\end{equation*}
which implies that $p\in B$. Therefore, we have proven that 
\[
A\subseteq B\tag{1}\label{1}.
\]
To show that $B\subseteq A$, let $p\in B$ be arbitrary. Then, there exist $a_0, a_1\in \mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
    p(x) = a_0 + a_1x
\end{equation*}
for any $x\in \mathbb{R}$. It is easy to see that $p(x)$ is twice differentiable, and
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    p'(x)  &= a_1\\
    p''(x) &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
Thus, $p\in A$, or
\[
B\subseteq A\tag{2}\label{2}.
\]
From \eqref{1} and \eqref{2}, it follows that $A = B$.
