    Assume that $W_1$ and $W_2$ are both subspaces of a vector space, $V$. Prove that $U=W_1\intersect W_2$ is also a subspace of $V$.

\begin{proof}
    To show that $U$ is a vector space of $V$, we need to prove the three following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The zero vector of $V$ belongs to $U$: Let $z$ be the zero vector of $V$. Since both $W_1$ and $W_2$ are subspaces of $V$, it follows that $z\in W_1$ and $z\in W_2$. Therefore, $z\in W_1\intersect W_2=U$.
        \item Vector addition is closed under $U$: Let $u,v\in U$. Since $U=W_1\intersect W_2$, $u,v\in W_1$ and $u,v\in W_2$. As both $W_1$ and $W_2$ are subspaces of $V$, vector addition is closed under both $W_1$ and $W_2$, or 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                u+v &\in W_1\\
                u+v &\in W_2
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Therefore, $u+v\in W_1\intersect W_2=U$, or vector addition is closed under $U$.
        \item Scalar multiplication is closed under $U$: Let $\lam\in\R$ and $u\in U$. Since $U=W_1\intersect W_2, u\in W_1$ and $u\in W_2$. As both $W_1$ and $W_2$ are subspaces of $V$, scalar multiplication is closed under both $W_1$ and $W_2$, or 
        \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \lam u &\in W_1\\
                \lam u &\in W_2
            \end{aligned}
        \]
        Therefore, $\lam u\in W_1\intersect W_2=U$, or scalar multiplication is closed under $U$.
    \end{enumerate}
    From the three following properties, $U$ must be a subspace of $V$.
