Assume $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces. Prove that if $L:V\to W$ is linear and injective and \hspace{.1cm} $v_1,\dots, v_n$ \hspace{.1cm} is a linearly independent list of vectors, then \hspace{.1cm} $L(v_1),\dots L(v_n)$  \hspace{.1cm} is a linearly independent list of vectors.
	
	
\noindent \emph{Note: You are free to use the following result that will be proved in class soon: for linear maps $L$, being injective is equivalent to the property that $L(v)=0$ only when $v=0$.}
