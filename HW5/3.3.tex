\begin{question} \noindent \textbf{NOTE}: In this problem, you can use material from LADR up through Section 3.A, as well as the definitions of injective and surjective functions given in Section 2 of this assignment (above). You can NOT use material from LADR 3.B for these questions. \\

	Define the function, $L:\P_4\to \P_2$ by the following rule:
	\begin{align*}
		\text{for}\ p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4 x^4,\ \ \ 
		(Lp)(x) = a_2 + a_3 x + a_4 x^2. 
	\end{align*}

	
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		
		\item Prove that $U=\{p\in\P_4\ :\ Lp = \text{zero polynomial}\}$ is a subspace of $\P_4$. \\
		\emph{Reminder: you cannot use results from LADR 3.B for these questions.}
		
		\item Give a basis for $U$. (No proof necessary.)
		
		\item Using the definition of an injective function (see Section 2 above), prove that $L$ is not injective.  
				
		\item Using the definition of a surjective function (See Section 2 above), prove that $L$ is surjective.  
	\end{enumerate}
